# Part 1 Reflection

### By: Nicholas Huter

Reading about the Transcribe Bentham project taught me a lot about about the process of making digital history. In general, in order to get work online, these projects need funding. The funding comes from people/companies that would like that information for themselves or for the public. In the case of the Transcribe Bentham project, it was funded for a different reason. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation wanted to evaluate the efficiency of crowdsourced transcription. The actual transcription was done by volunteers but there was money put into the transcription desk in order to make it more user friendly.
